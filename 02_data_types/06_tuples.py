Tuples
1. Tuples are similar to lists  except they are immutable
    - Tuples are ordered
    - Tuples index starts with 0
    - Tuples can have more than one data types
    - Tuples can be non-unique
    - Tuples can not be changed or modified once initialized
    - We can not add or remove elements from tuple

2. Tuples are represented by small brackets() instead of []
3. Tuples are faster than lists

# tuple with only one item



# accessing an item of a tuple



# accessing an item of a tuple with reverse index


# Updating values in a tuple gives an error



# if we want to add values to the tuple, we can re assign the value by adding it to another tuple


# finding the length of the tuple


# nested tuples


# accessing an item of the nested tuple
