## Quiz Q0301
Perform the addition operations between the following data types and check whether the code runs successfully or not:
1. `int` and `int` (Example: `5 + 5`)
2. `int` and `float` (Example: `5 + 5.5`)
3. `float` and `float` (Example: `5.5 + 5.5`)
4. `str` and `str` (Example: `'hello' + 'world'`)
5. `int` and `str` (Example: `5 + 'hello'`)


## Quiz Q0302
Use different operations in python to find out the following:

1. Square of **10**
2. **10<sup>20</sup>**
3. Integer division of **100** by **30**
4. What would be the remainder if 1289 is divided by 25? solve programmatically.

## Quiz Q0303
The following variables are assigned values as below:

```python
x = 10
y = 12
```

1. Check if x is greater than y
2. Check if y is greater than x
3. check if x is greater than or equal to y
4. check if y is greater than or equal to x
5. Check if x becomes equal to y if x is added by 2
6. Check if x is not equal to y after the previous operation

## Quiz Q0304
*"If the weather is cloudy today and it rained yesterday, it will rain today"*.

   Generate the logical operation for the statement above and evaluate the weather forecast for today.
    ```python
    cloudy_today = True
    rained_yesterday = True
    ```
    **Note**: *Change parameters to different values and see when the result changes*

## Quiz Q0305
Use *Identity* and *Membership* operations to solve the following problems

1. check whether the number `12` is an integer or not
2. divide `100` by `12` and check whether the number is `float` or not
3. suppose we have following lists:
   ``` python
   x = [1,2,3,4,5]
   y = [1,2,3,4,5]
   z = x
   ```
   1. Is `x` identical to `y`?
   2. Is `x` identical to `z`?

   *Solve problems programmatically and write the reasons why they are or are not identical with each other.*
4. Suppose there are following animals in the zoo:

   `elephant`, `tiger`, `zebra`, `lion`, `wolf`
   1. Check programmatically whether `lion` is in the zoo or not.
   2. Check programmatically whether `horse` is in the zoo or not.
5. Create a list of first 7 prime numbers and check whether 9 is a prime number or not using membership operation.


## Quiz Q0306
Use bitwise operations to perform the following:
1. Check the final value when `5` is performed bitwise AND with `7`
2. Check the final value when `5` is performed bitwise OR with `2`
3. `y = 10 * 2`. Solve the same problem using bitwise shift operation.
4. Multiply and divide an integer by 4 using bitwise shift operations.
