## Introduction

We can visualize python dictionaries as regular dictionary book. If we want to
find the meaning of the word `apple`, we search for the keyword `apple` and find the value associated to it.

Dictionaries in python are similar to lists but contains key-value pairs.
We generally access items of the dictionary using the key instead of index.

Some of the features of dictionary are as follows:
- Dictionaries are similar to lists but represented by _key-value_ pairs
- Dictionaries are ordered (since python 3.7)
- They are written inside _curley-brackets_ or _braces_ `{}`
- Keys must be unique otherwise the later one replaces the original one
- Dictionaries are mutable.
- Dictionaries can have multiple data types in their key-value pair

**Structure/syntax**
```python
{key_1: value_1, key_2: value2, ...}

# multiline
{
    key_1: value_1,
    key_2: value_2,
    ...
    key_n: value_n
}

```
