Typecasting is the process of conversion of data type from one to another. In
python, there are 2 different types of typecasting which are as follows:

1. Implicit typecasting
2. Explicit typecasting

## Implicit typecasting

If an interpreter converts the type of data by itself while executing an
statement, then it is known as an implicit conversion. In case of implicit
typecasting, lower precision data are automatically converted during operation.

Example:
```python
print(5 + 4.5)
```
In this case, the integer, (5) is  automatically converted into floating-point
data type and is then added to the mixture.

## Explicit typecasting

If we want to manually convert one data type from another, then it is known as
explicit typecasting.
