Write a program to create an empty list named `my_list` and

a. add numbers 5 and 9 to the list using `append()` method

b. ask the user to input any number in the console and add the number to the list.
    - you can use int() to change the type from string to integer if you want.

c. create another list `more_items` with 3 items on it and extend the list `my_list`
    using `extend` method.

d. now find the length of the list and print the length of list describing it in a sentence.
    - you can use string formatting for better outputs.

e. now remove the second item using `pop()` method and see if the item exists in the list
    - you can print the list before and after using the `pop()` method.
